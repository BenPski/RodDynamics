# RodDynamics
Implementations for the rod dynamics simulations and some documentation on how to use and how it is developed.

To get started with the project website [start here](Tutorial/tutorial.html)

To read about the development of the theory and the implementation look in the `Tutorial` directory. The simulations are split into directories to organize the order things are developed in and tested. Since this also documents the thought process behind the developments things get updated and replaced with each iteration in the tutorials. The recommended to use version is in the `python` folder for the python code.

The `convert.py` file should be ran to convert markdown files to html to be viewed in browser. It should already be ran before uploading, but if it needs an update then you will need [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to run it. Using pandoc the markdown files can also be converted to other file types like pdfs using latex.
