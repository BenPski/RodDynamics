<h1 class="title">Other Boundary Conditions</h1>
</header>
<p>So far weâ€™ve looked at the specific case where one end of the rod is fixed and the other end is free. Now, there are two obvious cases to look at: both ends fixed and both ends free. For both ends fixed we have a known value for <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> at both ends and for both ends free we have known values for <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> based on the tip loads. This still leaves the situation with mixed boundary conditions so we will have to solve the dynamics similarly to before.</p>
<p>As a specific case we can start with a rod that is fixed at both ends, starts out straight and horizontal, and allowed to droop due to gravity. To start we can make the boundary conditions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{gather}
g(0) = \begin{bmatrix} I &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \\
g(L) = \begin{bmatrix} I &amp; \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ L \end{bmatrix} \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{gather}\]</span></p>
